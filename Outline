generate iDs for each tday with indcs as components
iD length is from 1-x and should be descriptive enough to identify w >= .9 given θ,φ, & α values.
syntax = indc1_name.value,indc2_name.value,...,indcx_name.value


backtesting == forward-testing
  for all tdays in range find level 1 iDs generated on that day and forward-test this indication ´til end of global tday range
  what is the % bw/fw?
  is there periodicity?
