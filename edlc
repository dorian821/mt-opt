In one embodiment, selection of the pore structure matrix in the energy storage layer 116, selection of the separator paper for the separator 120, and selection of the electrolyte 122 provide an opportunity to tune the performance of the resulting GEC 100. By matching the ion size of the electrolyte 122 to the pore size of the energy storage layer 116 and the ion conductor size of the separator 120, highly efficient ion transport can be established producing much higher energy densities.
