Dear George,

Thank you for your prompt reply. 

I have processed a full refund, ****screenshot/receipt below***. I understand your caution and concern regarding the return of the order, however, there are no legal implications for doing so. It is not illegal, nor are you required to have any special licensing or insurance to do so. You may confirm this yourself.

Nevertheless, I am very sorry that you have endured such a painful experience with the product and the transaction has been an inconvenience. I have made every effort to resolve the issue to your satisfaction, and request that you honor our return policy and return the Mucuna. Without the specific pouches of Mucuna, the manufacturer will be unable to identify and address the problem. Furthermore, as no other customer has notified us of any problem with the Mucuna, the problem seems to be isolated to the pouches which you received. Consequently, we require the pouches which you have in order to properly address the issue. Thus out of respect for other customers, I request that return the pouches of Mucuna which you have purchased. The return shipping charges will be fully reimbursed. 

If you have any questions or concerns please don't hesitate to ask. It is always a pleasure to serve. 

Best Regards,
