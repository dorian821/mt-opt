Dear George,

Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I am very sorry to hear that you have had such a negative reaction to the Mucuna Pruriens. A full refund will be processed for the order. 

This is the first time any customer has reported a negative reaction to the Mucuna Pruriens, and consequently, we would like to notify the manufacturer that it may be investigated further to determine if this was a batch related issue or a broader problem. Therefore, to properly follow up and prevent it from re-occuring, we will need all of the product to be returned to our shipping facility in New Delhi, India. We will return it to the manufacturer and forward your experience for their review and full analysis. Any further details regarding your experience could be helpful to the manufacturer in tracking down the underlying cause. 

To proceed with the return and refund. All packages of the Mucuna will need to be shipped via a local shipping service provider with tracking to the address below. Once they have been dispatched, please scan and email the receipt from the shipment to me and a full refund, including the return shipping cost, will be processed immediately. The remaining products do not need to be returned.

I sincerely apologize for the distress and inconvenience that you have endured and greatly appreciate your patience and understanding. If you have any questions or concerns please don't hesitate to contact me.
