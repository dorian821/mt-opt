Dear DHL,

Thank you for forwarding your rate proposal for 2017. Unfortunately, with continual rate increases in spite of repeated agreements to contrary and a stagnate level of service your prices have ceased to be competitive. Such a flagrant increase of rates is not justified by the global macro-economic factors proposed here to do so. This proposal is in violation of a verbal agreement made with us earlier this year and an exploit of our business relationship. 

To begin, the macro-economic factors on which DHL depends have not increased to any degree to justify the proposed rate increase. Firstly, the inflation for 2017 is approximately 3.45% for 2016, down 0.77% from 2015 according to the Stat Bureau. Next, the USD increased less than 3% since 2015, down approximately 2% from the increase 2014-2015. Contrarily, the price of oil has decreased to approximately one third of its value in early 2014 and is in fact near a 10 year low. Despite, improving economic conditions, the proposed rate increase for 2017 is 150% of what it was for 2016. What is the justification for this?

In previous years, the rising cost of oil was used to justify rate increases, at which time exchange rates and inflation increased as they do currently. Now, however, that oil prices provide no justification these tenuous excuses are brought to the table. Oil is the most salient cost factor of a freight company such as DHL and these decreases far outweigh these meager and to-be-expected increases due to inflation and exchange rates. 

Furthermore, an additional 4% increase was tacked on to the initial proposed rate increase of the beginning of the year, at which time we were verbally guaranteed that there would be no increase for 2017. Despite this agreement, however, you have presented us with this increase. This is in violation of our agreement and eliminates the validity of any potential future agreements you could propose. If in 2016, after the initial increase, you imposed a second, and then guaranteeing that there would not be an increase in 2017, you go back on your word and impose one, what are we to expect from DHL if not exploitation of their presumed 'competitiveness'. I assure you that at these prices DHL's service is not competitive. 

Feel free to contact me if you can stand by your agreement made earlier in 2016. Otherwise, we will proceed with transferring our business to our other provider.
