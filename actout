Accounting Outline: 
A.  We need flexibility in the formatting to accommodate the following criteria: 
1.  Date or date range; ==:)O
2. stock(s); ==:)O
3. option position; ==:)O
4. option expiration dates; ==:)O
5. type of option i.e. put or call; ==:)O
6. sort  and form number;  ==:)O
7. “At Risk Amt”/ trade; ==:)O
8.  Time in the trade; ==:)O
9. win percentage given the selected date range i.e. 80%+ or 90%+;  ==:)O
10.  Profit percentage, either calculated by program or selected i.e. 20% or 100%+.  ==:)O
And for each of the above, rather than narrowing the field with the criteria, we have an “All Trades” criteria.

B.  We need the report to tell us:  
1. Given the selected criteria in A, 
2. how many trades during the given period (I’d call the first column “Trade #”);   
3. Investible market; 
4. win percentage;  
5. date entered the trade;  
6. date on which achieved calculated/selected profit;  
7. Max potential profit for individual trade; 
8. Date of max possible profit;  
9. date of exit if the trade fails to produce a win;  
10. Type of exit i.e. calculated like exit strategy 2 or d20cl;  
11. Running balance of at risk amt 
12. Net Profit or loss on trade; 
13. profit percent on individual trade; 
14. running balance of profit or loss.

This would be ideal. Tell me if this is to much work.  what do you think?  Changes, additions, deletions?

The flexibility desired in A can be had, but is limited by the interface of the program, which at this point is largely non-existent. Consequently, what I’m thinking is that we can generate a master report with all of the relevant data for the entire date range in question and then generate more selective reports based upon criteria which will select a sub-set of the master data set. 

The master report will contain the following data points, joining the TnP summary with the accounting: 

TnP Summary:

    - Trade #
    - Trade Date
    - Sort #
    - Strategy Formula
    - D2 Average Investible Market
    - Win %
    - Option_Type
    - Strike Position (stx)
    - Option-Symbol
    - D2 OHLCV
    - entry?
    - win?
    - successful_exit?
    - exit percentage
    - escape percentage
    - Trade’s profit/loss
    - Day number when calc sell achieved (D2 -D20)
    - Highest Hi as a percentage over purchase for the 20 day period
    - If 20% achieved over D2 purchase, then the day that it was achieved (D2-D20)
    - If 50% achieved over D2 purchase, then the day that it was achieved (D2-D20)
    - If 75% achieved over D2 purchase, then the day that it was achieved (D2-D20)
    - If 100% achieved over D2 purchase, then the day that it was achieved (D2-D20)
    

Accounting:

    - Date
    - Trades_To_Date
    - mgmt_policy
    - account_cash_balance
    - at_risk_balance
    - daily_profit/loss
    - daily_ROI
    - account_cash_balance 20%
    - at_risk_balance 20%
    - daily_profit/loss 20%
    - daily_ROI 20%
    - account_cash_balance 50%
    - at_risk_balance 50%
    - daily_profit/loss 50%
    - daily_ROI 50%
    - account_cash_balance 75%
    - at_risk_balance 75%
    - daily_profit/loss 75%
    - daily_ROI 75%
    - account_cash_balance 100%
    - at_risk_balance 100%
    - daily_profit/loss 100%
    - daily_ROI 100%
  

We need to track only one trade per buy point, whether 20th% or 40th%.   I think the one we choose should be the one with the highest  historical profit.
