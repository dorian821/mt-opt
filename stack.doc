TypeError: data type "datetime" not understood 



I've been using the function below to find the date in a series of dates that is closest to the target date. It was working fine until recently when I upgraded anaconda, numpy and pandas. 

It now returns the error above. I'll post the re-trace in a bit.

I've since downgraded back to pandas 0.19.2 and numpy 1.12.0 but it still returns the same error. Why would this happen?

I've also tried in on python.org/shell and it works fine with the versions above. What changed and how do I fix it?


def nearest_date(series,dat,i):
	aray = series.reset_index(drop=True)
	idx = np.abs(aray-dat).argmin()
	try:
		dat = aray[idx+i]
	except:
		try:
			dat = aray[idx-i]
		except:
			dat = aray[idx]
	dat = dt.date(dat.year, dat.month, dat.day)
	return exp
